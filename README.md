All the things that I learned how to do using Java.

I'll put things that took me so much time to learn, so it will be things such as window creation using JFrame, sprite animation, etc. 
> <h2> Some things that I'll show here👨‍💻</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Creating window With JFrame</li>
  <li>How to put elements on screen</li>
  <li>How to put images on screen</li>
</ul>

So I wish I can help someone who is having the same problems I had🙏🏻
